Appointment Scheduler

The purpose of the appointment scheduler is to provide a GUI based appointment scheduling application for a global
consulting organization.  The password protected application gives the user the ability to create/update/delete customers
and appointments from the company's chosen database system.  The application gives warning to a user if there is an
appointment within 15 minutes of the user's login, and shows them the appointment information should an appointment exist.
The user is also able to view reports about the number of customers, the number of appointments a given contact has, and
how many appointments of a certain type are in a chosen month. The appointment scheduler provides various error checking
and confirmations throughout, including if form fields are not fully filled out or confirming before a delete takes place.
