Auto Repair Scheduling Application

Built using Java with a MySQL database, the purpose of the Auto Repair Scheduling application is to provide a GUI based appointment scheduling application for a local auto repair shop.  The password protected application gives the advisor the ability to create/update/delete customers and appointments from the company's chosen database system.  The application gives warning to an advisor if there is an appointment within 15 minutes of the advisor's login, and shows them the appointment information should an appointment exist. The advisor is also able to view reports about the number of customers, the number of appointments a given tech has, and how many appointments of a certain type are in a chosen month. The appointment scheduler provides various error checking and confirmations throughout, including if form fields are not fully filled out or confirming before a delete takes place.

Below is the class diagram I created for the model componant of the MVC framework used to build the application and the user flow diagram:
